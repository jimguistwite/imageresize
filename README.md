Content Aware Image Resize in Scala
===================================

Based on work from a Coursera algorithms class take, this code
demonstrates how to resize images vertically or horizontally while
preserving the most significant content in the image and maintaining
the aspect ratio of the image.

Examples
--------

Original image (1024x678):

![Original](./image1.jpg)

100 pixels removed vertically (1024x578):

![Original](./image1-h.jpg)

100 pixels removed horizontally (924x678):

![Original](./image1-v.jpg)
